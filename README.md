Filename is an application loosely based off of an app that I worked with as a Technology Consultant in the Health IT space. It parses patient information from the filenames of files dropped into a folder.

Patient Registration is an app that resembles a patient registration form used by any healthcare organization. When the user submits the form, it should update the SQLite database.
